    <h1 class="head"> Welcome to my blog, I appreciate your interest in me. </h1>
    <p> My name is Elimar Bergado Garcia. I was born in Daly City California on November 17, 1998. I am Filipino
        <br> American. I graduated from Westmoor High School in 2016 and then did a year of college before I decided
        <br> to join the Marine Corps. I decided to join for a number of a reasons but mainly it was because I felt
        <br> I needed a change of environment and "do something with my life"...
